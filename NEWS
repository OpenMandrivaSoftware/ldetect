Version 0.13.1 - 17 January 2013, by Per Øyvind Karlsen

- make template implementations etc. internal
- use std::map for usbNames, yielding a ~36% performance increase (libstdc++
  only, using uClibc++'s std::map implementation suffers insane performance
  hit, so stick to old C implementation for now...)
- reduce size quite a bit by dropping unused functionality from usbNames class
- rename intf 'class' to 'interface'
- rewrite names.{h,cpp} into a proper C++ 'usbNames' class
- move more stuff into common classes with common interfaces
- kill error_and_die()
- also check return value of ifstream::eof() as ifstream::getline() has
  different behaviour for return value in uClibc++
- work around broken implementation of ostream fill & setw in uClibc++

Version 0.13.0 -  7 January 2013, by Per Øyvind Karlsen

- bump max devices number per bus from 100 to 300 (mga#8320)
- add pkgconfig file
- install headers into dedicated directory
- move functions from drakx perl module into a dedicated ldetect perl module
  so that it'll be easier to maintain and also since no stable API nor ABI
  can be expected in any near future
- implement a C++ stream class for zlib
- use names from dmi rather than the patterns matched against
- store names of pci classes in a hash map for faster lookups
- rewrite in C++
- make ldetect 3x faster
- fix retrieving info about USB devices with kernel-3.5+ (mga#7248)
- link with -flto & -Wl,-O1

Version 0.12.4 - 18 June 2012, by Per Øyvind Karlsen

- add support for building with -fwhole-program and use it by default
- fix generated usbclass.c & pciclass.c to have functions matching their
  prototypes

Version 0.12.3 -  6 June 2012, by Per Øyvind Karlsen

- replace deprecated kmod_module_get_filtered_blacklist()
- add support for building without zlib support

Version 0.12.2 - 22 May 2012, by Per Øyvind Karlsen

- generate PCI classes info using ids from pcutils header instead of deprecated
  kernel header (Andrey Bondrov)
- fix compile breakage
- accept $LDFLAGS
- use pkgconfig for getting required cflags & libs

Version 0.12.1 - 19 January 2012, Thierry Vignaud

- do not ignore /etc/modprobe.d/*
- fix reading freed memory

Version 0.12.0 - 13 January 2012, Thierry Vignaud

- switch from libmodprobe to new libkmod

Version 0.11.6 - 9 January 2012, Thierry Vignaud

- plug last (small) memleaks

Version 0.11.5 - 8 January 2012, Thierry Vignaud

- fix double free
- fix segfaulting when calling usb_probe() more than once

Version 0.11.4 - 5 January 2012, Thierry Vignaud

- plug some memleaks
- sync with names with usbutils-005
  (thus fixing more memleaks)

Version 0.11.3 - 21 November 2011, Thierry Vignaud

- make sure to behave properly on errors in libmodprobe (#3309)
- use saner API for quieting libmodprobe
- switch back to dynamically linking against libmodprobe

Version 0.11.2 - 18 October 2011, Thierry Vignaud

- adapt to new module-init-tools-3.16's API
- add new API for drakx's stage1 in order to find unknown PCI devices
- don't exit(1) on systems without pci (eg: ARM) (rtp)
- link statically with modprobe.so

Version 0.11.1 - 1 December 2009, Thierry Vignaud

- do not crash if there're more than 100 PCI devices
- further use libpci in order to check for PCIe capability

Version 0.11.0 - 1 October 2009, Thierry Vignaud

- reduce memory footprint

Version 0.10.0 - 30 September 2009, Thierry Vignaud

- do not display random revisions for USB devices
- retrieve PCI capabilities in order to better identify PCI Express devices

Version 0.9.1 - 28 September 2009, Thierry Vignaud

- fix inverted test for choosing between '8139cp' & '8139too' drivers (#53349)

Version 0.9.0 - 23 September 2009, Thierry Vignaud

- display PCI revision (#42576)
- try harder to fetch the right driver between '8139cp' & '8139too'
  according to PCI revision (#53349)

Version 0.8.6 - 23 September 2009, Pascal Terjan

- parse only once usb.ids (avoids displaying Duplicate errors)

Version 0.8.5 - 14 September 2009, Pascal Terjan

- do not display any warning when driver field is empty in
  /proc/bus/usb/devices (#53412)
- fix freed memory usage in criteria_from_dmidecode and entries_matching_criteria
- fix const warnings in dmi.c

Version 0.8.4 - 25 June 2009, Pascal Terjan

- fix freed memory usage in usb_probe and pci_probe
- use usb.ids

Version 0.8.3 - 20 April 2009, Pascal Terjan

- fix parsing of /proc/bus/usb/device I: lines and use the class
  of the first interface used by a driver instead of the first
  interface (or first one like before when none is used).
  That fixed presenting something as usb_storage even if the
  device is ignored by usb_storage driver and handled on another 
  interface by option driver
- ignore usb interfaces not active

Version 0.8.1 - 3 April 2009, Christophe Fergeau

- enumerate hid bus
- fixes some memory leaks

Version 0.8.0 - 27 March 2009, Olivier Blin

- do not use random string as device description
- use /sys/bus/usb/devices instead of /sys/class/usb_device
  (disabled in recent kernel) to find modalias
  (this breaks ABI because we now need to keep port number)

Version 0.7.26 - 14 May 2008, Thierry Vignaud

- adapt to pciutils-3.x API
