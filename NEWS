- retrieve PCI revision (#42576)

Version 0.8.6 - 23 September 2009, Pascal Terjan

- parse only once usb.ids (avoids displaying Duplicate errors)

Version 0.8.5 - 14 September 2009, Pascal Terjan

- do not display any warning when driver field is empty in
  /proc/bus/usb/devices (#53412)
- fix freed memory usage in criteria_from_dmidecode and entries_matching_criteria
- fix const warnings in dmi.c

Version 0.8.4 - 25 June 2009, Pascal Terjan

- fix freed memory usage in usb_probe and pci_probe
- use usb.ids

Version 0.8.3 - 20 April 2009, Pascal Terjan

- fix parsing of /proc/bus/usb/device I: lines and use the class
  of the first interface used by a driver instead of the first
  interface (or first one like before when none is used).
  That fixed presenting something as usb_storage even if the
  device is ignored by usb_storage driver and handled on another 
  interface by option driver
- ignore usb interfaces not active

Version 0.8.1 - 3 April 2009, Christophe Fergeau

- enumerate hid bus
- fixes some memory leaks

Version 0.8.0 - 27 March 2009, Olivier Blin

- do not use random string as device description
- use /sys/bus/usb/devices instead of /sys/class/usb_device
  (disabled in recent kernel) to find modalias
  (this breaks ABI because we now need to keep port number)

Version 0.7.26 - 14 May 2008, Thierry Vignaud

- adapt to pciutils-3.x API
